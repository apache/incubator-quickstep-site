          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Quickstep is a next-generation data processing platform that starts
            with an underlying relational kernel core. The key design philosophy
            is to ensure that these kernels - and compositions of these kernels
            - can exploit the full potential of the underlying hardware. Often
            this design principle is called running at bare-metal speeds.</p>

          <p>The general idea is to build into the DNA of the platform methods
             that fully exploit the common hardware that is available today,
             including large main memories, fast on-die CPU caches, highly parallel
             multi-core CPUs, and NVRAM storage technologies.</p>

          <p>For the hardware available in the future, we aim to co-design
            hardware and software primitives that will allow the data processing
            kernels to work on increasing amounts of data economically - both
            from the raw performance perspective, and from the perspective of
            the energy consumed by the data processing kernels and the applications
            running on the platform.</p>

          <p>The current roadmap is to produced a platform that can run relational
            database applications uisng SQL as the iterface. The longer-term
            roadmap is to cover a broader class of analytics.</p>

          <h3>Try Quickstep</h3>
          <p>Quickstep currently runs on a single node and supports a SQL
            front-end. Quickstep aims to deliver high-performance and requires
            no tuning and seamless setup. To get started, follow the
            <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-quickstep/blob/master/README.md">quickstart
            guide</a>. </p>
